I've found this post in my `_posts` directory, and went ahead and edited it and re-built the site to see my changes.

I can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates my site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, I'll simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. I'll take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
